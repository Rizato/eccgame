            <h3>Daily Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              Every day, we present you with an Bitcoin wallet address that mined a block during the
              50 bitcoin block reward, but has never spent it (with some exceptions for notable
              Satoshi addresses).
            </p>

            <p>
              Your challenge is to find the private key for the wallet from the public key using an
              elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) calculator.
            </p>

            <p>
              The game is quite literally impossible, and the only way to win is to already have the
              private key. If you have struggled to grasp the reality of how large 2^256 really is,
              this game will help you.
