              This application runs entirely in your browser. No data is transmitted to any server.
              All cryptographic operations, challenge verification, and game state are handled
              locally.

            <p>
              Your private keys are generated and stored only in your browser's memory. They are
              never transmitted or stored anywhere else. All cryptographic operations occur
              client-side.

              analytics. There are no cookies, session tracking, or server communications.

              This application does not use localStorage, sessionStorage, or any other persistent
              storage mechanisms. All game state is ephemeral and resets when you refresh the page
              or close your browser.

              Challenge data is loaded from a static configuration file included with the
              application. No external API calls or data fetching occurs during gameplay.
