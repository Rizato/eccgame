# ECC Crypto Playground

> **An interactive game demonstrating the computational impossibility of breaking Elliptic Curve Cryptography through Elliptic Curve Operations.**

ECC Crypto Playground is a browser-based game that challenges you to find private keys for real Bitcoin addresses using an ECC calculator. It's basically impossible - and that's exactly the point.

## What Is This?

This is a gamified elliptic curve cryptography calculator.
It lets you play with elliptic curve points and operations to ostensibly try to find an algorithm to go from a public key to private key.

It uses real Bitcoin wallets to be attractive to try to play, knowing full well they are totally safe.

### The Reality Check

The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem is the hard problem behind Bitcoin.

With a private key you can compute the public key in just log(n) steps, where n is the size of the key, which is ~2^256.
Without the private key, it would take a maximum of 2^256 steps to brute force a solution.

The best known classical algorithm can solve it in about 2^128 steps.

- **Age of Universe**: ~13.8 billion years (~13.8 ^ * 10^9)
- **Atoms in Observable Universe**: ~10^80
- **Operations Needed**: ~10^38

*You'd need to check more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, multiple times over.*

## Features

### 🎮 Game Modes

- **Daily Challenge**: A new impossible challenge every day
- **Practice Mode**: Learn with private keys provided (cheating enabled!)

### ECC Calculator

Perform elliptic curve operations:

- **Multiply**: Scale points by any number (×2, ×1000, ×2^256)
- **Divide**: Reverse multiplication (÷2, ÷7, ÷1000000)
- **Add**: Combine two points on the curve
- **Subtract**: Find the difference between points
- **Save Points**: Bookmark interesting locations for later

### Security & Privacy

- **100% Client-Side**: No data ever leaves your browser
- **Private Keys Stay Private**: All cryptographic operations in your browser
- **No Registration**: Play immediately, no accounts needed
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no cookies, no surveillance

### User Experience

- **Dark/Light Themes**: Easy on the eyes, day or night
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for quick startup
